# Sticky Note

A web app for writing and managing todo lists.

The todo's are written using markdown. 

React frontend, backend in NodeJS, Express & MongoDB

## Using the app
Go to [Sticky Note](https://sticky-note-todo.herokuapp.com/).

First of all you'll need an account, so go ahead and register.
### Create stacks and todo lists
To create a todo list, you need to first create a stack to put it in. 
1. Hit the Add Stack button in the sidebar to create it. You can edit it later.
1. Once you're in the stack, click Add Todo to create your todo list.
All of your todo lists will be shown under All Todo's. 
1. You can also pin a todo list to collect the ones you use often. Click the pin icon on the todo item and it will show up under Pinned.
### Collaborate with others
You can give access to another user to collaborate on a stack and the todo lists in it.
1. Go into the stack and hit the Edit Stack button, and you will find a search field.
1. Type the name or username of the person you want to share the stack with, and choose the person from the list. 

If you can't find them there, you may want to ask them to register an account.


Enjoy
